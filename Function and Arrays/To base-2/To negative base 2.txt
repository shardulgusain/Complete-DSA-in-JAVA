Leetcode 1017 :- Convert to base -2
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-to-base-2/
Given an integer n, return a binary string representing its representation in base -2.

Note that the returned string should not have leading zeros unless the string is "0".

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: "110"
Explantion: (-2)2 + (-2)1 = 2
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: "111"
Explantion: (-2)2 + (-2)1 + (-2)0 = 3
